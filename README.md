# Point-of-sale-logs-analysis
An exploratory analysis of POS logs to understand the customer's business and growth potential.


### Conclusions from exploratory analysis:

1. The sales logs are potentially from a bar cum restaurant chain having opened at new locations recently.

2. Growth rates at the high selling branches when compared year on year is flat, however, opening of new stores in 2016 and the quick sales growth on those locations indicates that the chain is succssful at pulling customers in. 

3. Overall, due to opening at new locations, the total revenue has grown by ~67% after discounting for the data loss in the initial parts of 2015.

4. As a conclusion, continuing a business relationship with the chain seems right, given the year on  year growth. However, more insights on the margins and net spends would give a much better financial picture of how profitable the chain is and where it's future lies.
